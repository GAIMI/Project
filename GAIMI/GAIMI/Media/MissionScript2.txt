201 Right its time to get GAIMI back out into the  field for some more analysis.
201 After a meteor shower yesterday one of the bridges over a chasm has been knocked loose and fallen into the chasm.
201 Unfortunately the selected dig site is past this chasm. Fortunately, some materials were left out by other researchers. 
201 By collecting these materials GAIMI can easily construct and place a bridge.

212 Great! With the supplies in this crate building a bridge will be no problem at all!

222 Interesting, that sample contained Nitrate! This is often used as fertiliser on earth, which aids plant growth. 
222 If we could get plants on Mars, it might help to stabilise the atmosphere!

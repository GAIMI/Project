001 Welcome young scientist, to the Geophysical Analysis Interplanetary Machine Interface, or GAIMI for short! 
001 My name is Dr Ogel, and this is my assistant, Professor Blue.
002 Nice to meet you.
001 I am your team leader for the GAIMI mission to mars! I’ll be telling you what to expect when GAIMI lands.
001 Professor Blue will be describing to you what the readings on GAIMI are and eventually what it finds on the red planet. 
001 It is Your job is to tell our little rover where to go.
001 If this mission goes well, we might even get the all clear to extend our research to other planets with GAIMI!
001 With each mission you must analyse the planet to find if it is habitable to humans and whether we can extend our reach beyond earth.
001 Are you ready? Then let's begin!
001 
101 Using the controls to the left of the screen: drag and drop movements and functions to the bar at the bottom.
101 For your first mission travel to the selected location and dig for a dirt sample to analyse.
101 Once you have dug in the required spots your mission is complete .
101 Though be warned spending too much time on the planet's surface heightens the risk of being caught in a sandstorm!
101 I've got to get back to the lab, I'll leave you in the capable hands of my assistant!

112 According to GAIMI’s analysis, Mars' atmosphere is awful! On Earth, our atmosphere is 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and 0.03% carbon dioxide.
112 The readings here show Mars’ atmosphere has 95.97% carbon dioxide, which is actually poisonous to humans! Not good initial readings, Doctor!

122 Doctor, look at this! GAIMI is picking up high levels of ionising radiation. Here on earth, only a small amount gets through, because of how strong our magnetic field is.  
122 This must mean that Mars has a very weak magnetic field, if at all. That much radiation would cause all sorts of issues to the human body if unprotected!
121 Good work ! I think that’s enough for today, a sandstorm is due soon so bring GAIMI back to base.

301 An unexpected level 4 Sandstorm swept the  research site  a few hours ago.
301 It has damaged  a large amount of the equipment in the area and a number of researchers were in the vicinity when it happened
301 Should you find any stranded and in need of help GAIMI is able to sustain the weight of several passengers.
301 Once this dig is done it should be all we need to figure out if mars is habitable for a full human colony.

312 These pressure readings are off. Pressure is measures in Millibars, and here on earth the pressure is 1013.25 Millibars. 
312 On Mars, according to GAIMI, the pressure is only up to 14 Millibars.
312 That must explain why the oxygen levels are so low, because low pressure means less oxygen in a given amount of air.

322 Oh my goodness, you've just found liquid water! 
322 This is the most basic element that researchers look for on potentially habitable planets!!
321 That is good news Professor, but Mars' issues are bigger than we imagined.
321 But GAIMI is up and working, which is great! It's time to leave the solar system!
